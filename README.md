# NeuroUrbanism_EXP
BPN Institute of TU Berlin project in collaboration with University of Amsterdam and Hafen City Universit√§t Hamburg. This research project is a interdisciplinary collaboration of Architecture, Neuroscience and Psychology. The main point is to investigate how different tasks in simulated urban areas changes our perception and the way we execute those tasks. The experiment was completely programmed by myself, the stimuli were created by Samuel Pahlke from Hafen City University Hamburg. If one wants to use them, let me know and i can send them.
